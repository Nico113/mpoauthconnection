= Introduction =

MPOAuthMobile is a sample application showing how to link and use MPOAuth with your iPhone or iPod Touch application. It differs from MPOAuthClient since it's not really useful as a diagnostic tool since text input on the iPhone is nowhere near as easy as on a desktop. Instead it utilizes the MPOAuthAPI delegate API to manually take part in the automatic authorization to prevent the default launch of an external browser to handle requesting user access credentials.
